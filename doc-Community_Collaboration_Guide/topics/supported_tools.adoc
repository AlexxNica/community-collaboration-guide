=== GitBook

GitBook is a documentation hosting system based on GitHub.

Website: https://www.gitbook.com

Advantages::
* Very low barrier to entry for community members
** Easy to make edits
** Comes with a built in stylesheet
* Publishes in Asciidoc
* Integrates into GitHub
* Allows for inline comments
* GitBook supports building books written in multiple languages.
** Each language is in a subdirectory
** There is support for rtl languages
* Includes full text search engine
** JSON index file on a static version of the documentation

Challenges::
* Having to review inline comments is time consuming when you’re also monitoring JIRAs
* Converting to downstream requires a Python script
* Requires a lengthy process to pull content from Gitbook downstream
* Directory tree defined by GitBook and does not allow for easy manipulation
* Only free for a small number of managers, has a cost after that
* Things that work in Asciidoc don’t always work in GitBook
** Certain special tags will completely break things in GitBook
** Asciidoc is not fully supported in GitBook
* GitBook requires that we use a JSON file for attributes which is not as flexible as Asciidoc
** Asciidoc you can embed attributes, but in JSON you can’t
* GitBook support is not responsive
* Edits are immediately committed
* Editor is not advanced enough to keep in conditional tags in place
